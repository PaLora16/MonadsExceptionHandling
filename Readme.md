# Monads design pattern
A Monad design pattern used in functional programming caught my attention recently. Composing functions can also benefit from the same pattern. In monads, functions are chained together, passing arguments between them and providing metadata about any potential exceptions. When an exception occurs in the middle of the chain, the rest functions pass the information about the exception down. The monad never raises its own exceptions, only setting error metadata. Exception handling is avoided, leading to more conscious code from the caller.
