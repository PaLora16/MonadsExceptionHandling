# Monads design pattern
Functional programming decomposes tasks into single functions, which are then composed back into trees of expressions. Functional style can be used in Python even though it is not typically a functional language. The monad design pattern can be used in this way. In monads, functions are chained together, passing arguments, and providing metadata about exceptions. If an exception occurs in the middle of the chain, the rest of the functions pass the exception information down. Exceptions are never raised by the monad, only error metadata are set. Since exception handling is avoided, callers can write more conscious code.
